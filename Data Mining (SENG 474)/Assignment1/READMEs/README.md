**There are two files of code, one file is for the first problem pertaining to the heart disease dataset and the other one is for the problem selected by me (tic-tac-toe game). The second problem was selected from the UCI repository.**

<br />

#### How to run code:

Both the code files are jupyter notebooks and to run them they just need to be given the correct python environment (I used pyhton 3.9.9 64-bit to implement and test my code). The .data files need to be in the same directory as the notebook in order for the program to read the data.
