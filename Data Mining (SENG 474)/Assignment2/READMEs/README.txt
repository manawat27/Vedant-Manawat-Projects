There is a single python file (jupyter notebook file) for the entire assignment.

How to run code:

The code file is a jupyter notebooks and to run them they just need to be given the correct python environment (I used pyhton 3.9.9 64-bit to implement and test my code).
The data file needed for this exists in the fashion-mnist-master/data/fashion directory.
The fashion-mnist-master/data directory should be in the same working directory as the notebook.

One flaw I noticed was that when running the notebook from top to bottom the data files could not be recognized the second time and so if this need to happen (the notebook needs to be fun twice) the fashion-mnist-master/data folder should be copied back to the working directory.
