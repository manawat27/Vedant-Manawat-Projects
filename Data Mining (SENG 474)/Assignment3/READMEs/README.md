**There is a single python file (jupyter notebook file) for the entire assignment.**

<br />

#### How to run code:

The code file is a jupyter notebooks and to run them they just need to be given the correct python environment (I used pyhton 3.9.9 64-bit to implement and test my code).
The datasets needed for this need to be in the same directory as the ntebook.
